Welcome to my personal website! You can call me Afi. I am a PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, [School of Economics](https://econ.gatech.edu).

My research interests are in energy and environmental economics, applied microeconomics, and empirical industrial organization.

I am originally from Indonesia, a wonderful country in Southeast Asia. Before starting my PhD, I worked as an academic professional at [Institute of Technology Bandung](https://www.itb.ac.id/?n=1728695487) and as expert consultant for various energy and environmental policy think tanks.
