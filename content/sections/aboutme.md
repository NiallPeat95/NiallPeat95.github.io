Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, [School of Economics](https://econ.gatech.edu).

My research interests are energy and environmental economics, applied microeconomics, and empirical industrial organization. My existing work focuses on how households and firms respond to the broad impact of climate change and the energy transition.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as an academic professional at [Institute of Technology Bandung](https://www.itb.ac.id/?n=1728695487) and as an expert consultant for various energy and environmental policy think tanks in Indonesia.
