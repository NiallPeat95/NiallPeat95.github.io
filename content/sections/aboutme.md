I am a third year PhD student in economics at [Emory University](https://economics.emory.edu).

My research interests are in quantitative macroeconomics, international trade and spatial economics. 

I joined Emory from Australia having graduated with a Bachelor of Economics from the University of Adelaide. Before Emory I worked at public policy institutions in Australia including central banking at the RBA and industry policy analysis at the Australian Treasury.
